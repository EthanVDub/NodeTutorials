# NodeTutorials
The two folders within this repo correspond to the Node and Express crash course tutorials by Traversy Media.

Express: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L72fhGm1tfE

Node: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4

These tutorials helped me a lot in transitioning from creating Rest endpoints using Scala, which I have had experience with in the past, to
creating basic ones in Express/Node.
